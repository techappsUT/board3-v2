## 🔒 Security Standards

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor with hardware key support
- **Architecture**: Zero-trust with microsegmentation
- **Compliance**: OWASP Top 10, GDPR ready
- **Key Management**: HSM integration with automatic rotation

## ⚡ Performance Targets

- **API Response**: <1ms simple, <10ms complex operations
- **Database Queries**: <5ms OLTP, <50ms analytics
- **Frontend Loading**: <1.5s FCP, <3s TTI
- **AI Generation**: <10s for infrastructure designs
- **Concurrent Users**: 1,000+ with auto-scaling

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory:

### 📋 Core Documentation
- **[Product Requirements](./docs/product-requirements.md)** - Complete PRD with features and specifications
- **[Technical Architecture](./docs/architecture/technical-architecture.md)** - System design and implementation
- **[Security Requirements](./docs/security/security-requirements.md)** - Military-grade security standards
- **[Development Workflow](./docs/workflows/development-workflow.md)** - Sequential methodology and quality gates

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Product Team**: Start with [Product Requirements](./docs/product-requirements.md)
2. **Developers**: Review [Development Workflow](./docs/workflows/development-workflow.md)
3. **DevOps**: Study [Technical Architecture](./docs/architecture/technical-architecture.md)
4. **Security**: Reference [Security Requirements](./docs/security/security-requirements.md)

## 🔄 Development Methodology

Board3 follows a **sequential development framework** with:

### Triple Self-Review Process
1. **Functionality Validation** - Requirements, testing, performance
2. **Security & Performance Audit** - OWASP compliance, optimization
3. **Architecture & Documentation Review** - Patterns, future compatibility

### Quality Gates
- ✅ **100% completion** required before next phase
- ✅ **Security validation** at every step
- ✅ **Performance targets** maintained throughout
- ✅ **Documentation updates** with each feature

### Automated Workflows
- 📝 **Auto-documentation** after feature completion
- 🔄 **Git automation** with comprehensive commit messages
- 📊 **Performance tracking** with each build
- 🛡️ **Security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Planned Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript, PostgreSQL
- **Canvas**: React Flow for visual design
- **AI**: OpenAI integration for infrastructure generation
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for multi-cloud deployment
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or Supabase with MFA support
