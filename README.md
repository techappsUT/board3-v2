# Board3 v2

A modern full-stack application built with security-first principles and high-performance architecture.

## Project Status

üèóÔ∏è **Foundation Phase** - Setting up core infrastructure

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: TBD (Go/Rust/Python/Django)
- **Frontend**: TBD (React/Next.js/TypeScript)
- **Database**: TBD (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB)
- **Search**: TBD (OpenSearch/Solr)
- **Authentication**: TBD (Auth0/Supabase)

### Security Standards

- Military-grade encryption (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- TLS 1.3 minimum with mTLS for service communication
- Zero-trust architecture
- Hardware security module integration

### Performance Targets

- API responses: <1ms simple, <10ms complex
- Database queries: <5ms OLTP, <50ms search
- Frontend loading: <1.5s FCP, <3s TTI

## Development Workflow

This project follows a sequential development methodology with:

1. **Triple Self-Review Process** for each feature
2. **Incremental Development** with dependency validation
3. **Automated Documentation** updates
4. **Military-Grade Security** at every layer

## Getting Started

Project setup and development instructions will be added as the foundation is established.
