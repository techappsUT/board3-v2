## Quick Navigation

### For Developers

1. Start with [Development Workflow](./workflows/development-workflow.md) to
   understand the process
2. Review [Technical Architecture](./architecture/technical-architecture.md) for
   implementation details
3. Follow [Security Requirements](./security/security-requirements.md) for
   secure coding practices

### For Product Management

1. Review [Product Requirements Document](./product-requirements.md) for
   complete specifications
2. Reference [Technical Architecture](./architecture/technical-architecture.md)
   for technical feasibility

### For Security Teams

1. Study [Security Requirements](./security/security-requirements.md) for
   compliance standards
2. Review [Development Workflow](./workflows/development-workflow.md) for
   security integration

### For DevOps/Infrastructure

## Documentation Standards

### Maintenance

- **Auto-Generated Sections**: Performance metrics, API endpoints, and project
  status
- **Manual Updates**: Architecture decisions, security policies, and workflow
  changes
- **Version Control**: All documentation changes tracked with feature
  implementations

### Format

- **Markdown**: All documentation in GitHub-flavored Markdown
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid syntax for architectural and workflow diagrams
- **Code Examples**: TypeScript/JavaScript with proper syntax highlighting

### Review Process

- Documentation updates required for all feature completions
- Architecture changes must update relevant diagrams
- Security modifications require compliance review

## Living Documentation

This documentation evolves with the project:

- **Real-time Updates**: README and metrics auto-generated after feature
  completion
- **Architectural Evolution**: Diagrams updated as system grows
- **Performance Tracking**: Benchmarks updated with each phase
- **Security Evolution**: Compliance status tracked continuously

## Getting Started

1. **New Team Members**: Start with
   [Product Requirements Document](./product-requirements.md)
2. **Development Setup**: Follow
   [Development Workflow](./workflows/development-workflow.md)
3. **Security Implementation**: Reference
   [Security Requirements](./security/security-requirements.md)
4. **Architecture Understanding**: Study
   [Technical Architecture](./architecture/technical-architecture.md)
