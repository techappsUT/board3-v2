# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Board3

## Version History
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: August 19, 2025
- **Author**: Grok (AI Assistant)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Revision Notes**: Initial draft based on analysis of Brainboard.co features. Future revisions may incorporate user feedback, stakeholder reviews, and technical feasibility assessments.

## 1. Executive Summary
Board3 is a comprehensive, AI-powered platform for designing, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure. Inspired by leading tools like Brainboard, it provides a visual "canvas" for end-to-end cloud operations, emphasizing collaboration, standardization, security, and automation. The platform generates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, supports multi-cloud environments, and integrates AI for rapid infrastructure creation.

Key differentiators:
- Visual designer with real-time Terraform code generation.
- AI-driven automation for natural language-based infrastructure builds.
- Built-in CI/CD, drift detection, templating, and RBAC for secure, scalable workflows.

The product targets DevOps teams, cloud engineers, and organizations aiming to mature their cloud practices. It will be built with a modern tech stack to ensure performance, security, and maintainability.

**High-Level Goals**:
- Reduce cloud infrastructure setup time by 50% through visual and AI tools.
- Enforce security and cost optimization from design phase.
- Support seamless multi-cloud operations without vendor lock-in.

**Success Metrics**:
- User adoption: 80% of beta users report improved productivity.
- Feature usage: 70% utilization of AI and templating features.
- System reliability: 99.9% uptime, with automated drift detection accuracy >95%.

## 2. Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges in managing cloud infrastructure:
- **Complexity**: Manual Terraform coding is error-prone and time-consuming, especially for non-experts.
- **Collaboration**: Teams struggle with siloed tools, leading to inconsistencies in standards, naming, and security.
- **Security and Compliance**: Late-stage security checks result in vulnerabilities; drift between code and reality causes surprises.
- **Scalability**: Cloning repos for new projects wastes time; CI/CD pipelines require constant maintenance.
- **Multi-Cloud Management**: Switching between providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI) increases overhead.

Board3 solves these by providing a unified, visual platform that automates design, enforces best practices, and integrates security/cost controls from day one.

## 3. Target Audience
- **Primary Users**:
  - Cloud Engineers/DevOps Professionals: For designing and deploying infrastructures.
  - Platform Teams: For standardizing templates and workflows.
  - Developers: For self-serve infrastructure without deep IaC knowledge.
- **Secondary Users**:
  - Security Teams: For RBAC and compliance monitoring.
  - Managers: For oversight via dashboards and versioning.
- **User Personas**:
  - **Persona 1: Alex the DevOps Engineer** - Needs quick prototyping with AI, multi-cloud support, and drift detection.
  - **Persona 2: Jordan the Platform Lead** - Focuses on templating, RBAC, and integrations to enforce standards.
  - **Persona 3: Sam the Junior Developer** - Requires intuitive visual tools to contribute without Terraform expertise.

**Market Size**: Aimed at mid-to-large enterprises in tech, finance, and healthcare sectors adopting multi-cloud strategies.

- Validation for security, cost, and scalability best practices.

#### 4.1.4 Templating and Standardization
- Create reusable templates for architectures, variables, tags, and naming conventions.
- Automatic application of standards during design to ensure consistency.
- Avoid repo cloning by referencing existing templates.

#### 4.1.5 Terraform Management
- Secure remote backend for state storage with encryption at rest/transit.

- Secure by default: Enforce HTTPS, JWT authentication, input validation.
- Data encryption: All sensitive data (e.g., API keys) encrypted using industry standards (AES-256).

#### 4.1.8 Integrations
- Centralize tools: APIs for third-party integrations (e.g., monitoring, cost tools).
- Git workflows: Push/pull from repositories.

### 4.2 Additional Features (Should-Have)
- Dashboard for monitoring deployments, costs, and changes.
- Export/Import designs as JSON/YAML for portability.
- Customizable UI themes for accessibility.

### 4.3 Nice-to-Have Features (Could-Have)

### 4.4 Out-of-Scope (Won't-Have for v1)
- On-premises deployment support.
- Custom cloud provider integrations beyond the four mentioned.
- Built-in billing management (rely on integrations).

## 5. Technical Stack and Architecture
Board3 will be built as a full-stack web application with a focus on security, performance, and scalability.

### 5.1 Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (v14+) with TypeScript for server-side rendering, static generation, and API routes.
- **Key Libraries**:
  - React for UI components.
  - Tailwind CSS for styling (responsive, themeable).
  - React Flow or a similar library for visual drag-and-drop designer.
  - Axios for API calls, with interceptors for auth tokens.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Component-based architecture with hooks for state management (e.g., useContext, useReducer).
  - Server Components for data fetching to optimize load times.
  - Accessibility: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation.
  - Security: Sanitize inputs, use Content Security Policy (CSP).

### 5.2 Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js (v20+) with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- **Framework**: Express.js or NestJS for API structure (NestJS preferred for its modular, injectable design).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, templates, states); Redis for caching/session management.
- **Key Libraries**:
  - Prisma ORM for database interactions (type-safe queries).
  - Terraform.js or custom wrappers for code generation and execution.
  - BullMQ for job queues (e.g., drift scans, AI processing).
  - JWT for authentication; bcrypt for password hashing.
  - OpenAI SDK (or similar) for AI features, with rate limiting.
- **Architecture**:
  - Microservices-oriented: Separate services for auth, designer, CI/CD.
  - API: RESTful endpoints with GraphQL for complex queries (e.g., /api/designs, /api/ai/generate).
  - Event-driven: Use WebSockets (Socket.io) for real-time collaboration.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Secure by Default: Helmet middleware for headers, rate limiting with express-rate-limit.
  - Error Handling: Centralized logging (Winston), global error middleware.
  - Optimization: Caching with Redis, lazy loading for large datasets.
  - Testing: Jest for unit/integration tests, coverage >80%.

### 5.3 Deployment and Infrastructure
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS/GCP for scalability (use the platform's own dogfooding).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or similar for automated builds/tests/deploys.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics; Sentry for error tracking.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with load balancers; containerization via Docker/Kubernetes.

### 5.4 Data Flow
- User designs visually → Frontend sends to Backend → Backend generates Terraform → Stores in DB/Backend → Deploys via CI/CD.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Page loads <2s; AI generation <10s.
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10 compliance; regular audits. Encrypt all PII; MFA for logins.
